 * Tikifez's SASS Boilerplate v1.0.0 (http://www.github.com)
 *
 * Files are structured so each category has a master include here, then
 * additional sass files will be in each subdirectory and included in the
 * master file for that category, e.g. for common you may have
 * _header.scss and _footer.scss, which you'd import in the master file
 * of common/_common.scss.
 *
 * Included mixins:
 *
 * Reset: html5doctorsreset
 * Breakpoints: for-size()
 * Ratio Handling: maintain-ratio()
 * Strip Unit: strip-unit()
 * Type Scale: type-scale()
 *
 * The for-size() mixin is from The 100% Correct Way to Do CSS Breakpoints
 * https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862
 *
 * The HTML5 Reset Stylesheet is sourced from HTML5 Doctor
 * http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/
 *
 * Maintain Ratio is sourced from Brian Mcallister
